Project Accessibility Report
-
As a group, answer the following questions — place your answers in a file called accessibility-report.md in your group's GitHub repository:
We did our best.

For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

Principle 1: Equitable Use
-
- Recipes are accessible to users regardless of their dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc.).
- The interface does not limit users with specific needs or preferences. Future enhancements could include supporting multiple languages to ensure accessibility for users worldwide.

Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
-
- Users can search by available ingredients or dietary filters, allowing flexibility based on their situation.
- Random recipe generators offer options for both beginners and advanced cooks.

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- 
- Created labels like "Search Recipes" and "Save Recipe." for clear access
- Intuitive navigation through the app with the use of simple instructions and visual aids.

Principle 4: Perceptible Information
-
- Name of the recipe is displayed with a image to help comprehension
- Clear icons for the recipes makes the app accessible even for users with limited literacy
- The addition of features like high-contrast design and alternative text for images could make the app more accessible to users with visual impairments.

Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
-
- Users can edit or remove saved recipes without penalty.
- Ingredient search provides suggestions when an item is looked for to reduce errors.

Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
-
- Features like "Save Recipe" and "Random Recipe Generator" reduce the time needed to plan meals.
- Users can quickly filter and search without needing extensive typing or navigation.

Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
-
- Large, spaced out buttons and text fields make the app easy to navigate for any users
- The interface is designed to minimize clutter, ensuring clear visibility and ease of navigation even on different size screens.


    Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

If we were to market our program, we would target home cooks and people who enjoy cooking, allowing them to discover and organize recipes tailored to their dietary restrictions and the ingredients they have. This includes people who try to reach specific nutrition such as vegan or vegetarian or who are managing intolerances and may find it hard to find recipes. Additionally, the program targets individuals who are too busy so they can find a quick and easy recipe to follow to save time in the kitchen. By incorporating, filters, ingredient searching, and step-to-step instructions, this project offers a valuable program for anyone looking to increase their cooking capabilities

    Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

This program may be less likely to be used by the elderly who may lack the skills to use technology or struggle navigating the interface. They may face challenges with reading small text, complex menus, or features that require digital literacy. Furthermore, the program does not include a text-to-speech function which could drive away users who are visually impaired or those who find it easier to listen to instructions rather than read them. Without these features, the program may alienate a demographic that could benefit from a more accessible, user-friendly recipe app. Addressing these disparities by incorporating easier navigation, larger text options, and text-to-speech features can make the program more accessible to everyone.
